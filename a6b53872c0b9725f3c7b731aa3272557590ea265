      "message": "I don\u0027t understand why this is needed.  We\u0027re seeing ACL support successfully built on CentOS 7 and Rocky Linux 8.  I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve previously tested it on a large number of platforms using containers.\n\n`HAVE_ACL_GET_FD_NP` is logically used in 2 places:\n\n1. In `src/include/os/linux/acl.h` and `src/os/linux/acl.c`, to decide if the\n   replacement should be declared and built.\n   \n2. In `src/CMakeLists.txt` to decide if the feature needs to be disabled.  There,\n   the condition for disabling is:\n   ```(NOT (HAVE_ACL_GET_FD_NP OR LINUX))```\n   So, this can only be disabled if the platform isn\u0027t Linux.\n   \nWhat platform isn\u0027t this working on?\n\nI\u0027ll test running cmake in a bunch of containers and see if I can see a failure.",
