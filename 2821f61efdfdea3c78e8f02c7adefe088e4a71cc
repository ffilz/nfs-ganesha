      "message": "We\u0027ll wait for Frank to give his opinion.  My thought is a tentative no, and the reason is that it\u0027s only one of 55 error types that\u0027s getting it\u0027s own macro, and adding 55 macros is a definite no.  So for consistency, I\u0027d vote for what we have now.  But let\u0027s let Frank weigh in.",

      "message": "Yea, I would prefer not to make changes like this. While it may help readability to handle common error this way, it also introduces bumps for merging back ported patches down the road. And as Daniel says, we can\u0027t have a macro for every error. Also, there is no guarantee new code would use the shortcut, diluting it.",
