      "message": "Could you split this to handle each lock in a separate patch.\n\nThe obj_lock is only taken read in two places and I don\u0027t think either are very critical to performance, so that\u0027s a good one to replace with mutex.\n\nMostly the fsm_lock has low utilization so could be a mutex, but FSAL_MEM uses it in a way that I\u0027d like better characterization. On the other hand, other than FSAL_MEM it\u0027s not used in any critical paths so if it stays a rwlock the only impact would be on FSAL_MEM which should be separately investigated to see if it impacts the types of performance evaluation FSAL_MEM was written for.\n\nI\u0027m a little more concerned about the mdcache locks.",
