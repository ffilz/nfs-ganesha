      "message": "I feel returning an error when one remove export fails is not enough. What I want to remove 3 exports, first succeeds and second fails?\n\nIt just returns a failure, instead the result should be, export 1 -\u003e success, export 2 -\u003e failed and export 3 -\u003e skipped.\n\nOr a single export failure should not be treated as a complete failure in this case. We should try to remove all exports and report failure or success for each one of them.\n\n@Frank and @Dan: Any thoughts?",
