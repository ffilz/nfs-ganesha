You shouldn\u0027t call any ntirpc methods before calling svc_init(), which is why this was split in the first place.",

      "message": "I agree with you on this.\n\nIn the existing implementation as well, the function `svcauth_gss_set_svc_name` is called before `svc_init`. It works today, because the `svc_init` does not interact with `svc_auth_gss.c`. If that changes in the future, it can break things.\n\nHowever, this CL does not attempt to fix that. It only does the refactoring with the same assumption that `svc_auth_gss` methods can be called before `svc_init`. I fix this assumption in the next CL (https://review.gerrithub.io/c/ffilz/nfs-ganesha/+/1193526), by calling `gss_principal_init` after `nfs_Init_svc`.",
