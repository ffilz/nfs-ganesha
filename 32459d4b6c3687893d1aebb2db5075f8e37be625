That is, have it be outside the PREFIX, even if it\u0027s given?\n\nExactly, I use prefix to install in a read-only location, so runtime data cannot be there.\nI don\u0027t mind where the default is as long as it can be set at compile time -- these could also be overriden by config but that\u0027s annoying.",
