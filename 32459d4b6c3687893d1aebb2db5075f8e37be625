      "message": "\u003e So my understanding is that you are using PREFIX, but want RUNTIMEDIR to be handled differently than SYSSTATEDIR and the rest?  That is, have it be outside the PREFIX, even if it\u0027s given?\n\nExactly, I use prefix to install in a read-only location, so runtime data cannot be there.\nI don\u0027t mind where the default is as long as it can be set at compile time -- these could also be overriden by config but that\u0027s annoying.",

      "message": "Alright, sorry for the multiple updates, writing this made me realize I want to move SYSSTATEDIR anyway -- so the main point of this patch for me is just to not have cmake create the directory.\n\nThe latest update removes the path change (although I still think /run is preferred over /var/run on systemd distros, most have a symlink so it should be fine), I kept the separate setting because it somewhat makes sense to have but not fussy about it either way.\nOther than that default path doesn\u0027t change, it\u0027s really just a mkdir being removed and pushed down to init scripts or packagers to do as they see fit.",
