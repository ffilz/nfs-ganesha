      "message": "Does this have an option of using the atomic counters we already have for many of the metrics? Keeping duplicate counters seems a waste.\n\nI think it would actually be worth having a discussion on the mailing list or in a github issue about plans for Prometheus monitoring.\n\nWe also need to address the scalability of having many \"per-xyz\" metrics.",

The next commit migrates the existing metrics to the new API.\nAccording to our internal performance tests, the infrastructure proposed here scales well due to:\n1. Using atomic int instead of atomic double\n2. Defining the metrics at init time, and not during IOs",
