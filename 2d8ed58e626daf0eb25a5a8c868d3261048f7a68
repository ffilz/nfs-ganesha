      "message": "I\u0027ve tested this extensively and it works. With a linux kernel client, it even mostly worked before, except for directories with NFSv4 style junctions (NetApp, I\u0027m looking at you). That\u0027s how we found the bug.\n\nI have a lot of changes in flight at the moment. Can we accept this now, and do the utf8str change later?",
