      "message": "Most of these look like some scan of stuff in /dev with stat on everything, I wouldn\u0027t think ganesha really needs that?.\n\nWould be handy to figure what, I just tried running a vfs FSAL and according to strace it only stats block devices.. but I recall seeing all of these on a production ganesha and I just let selinux block it all, e.g. mark these as dontaudit instead of allow, without really digging where they came from... For us it\u0027d probably be better to understand a bit what does that...",
