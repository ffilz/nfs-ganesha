      "message": "yes, after this change. Original DBus command for ShowCacheInode would not use as before.\n\nFor python CLI, I would make it work normally, but dbus command would fail after this commit. I am not sure how we do if we want to change the dbus interface.\n\nMaybe write to document? or kept the old dbus command?",
