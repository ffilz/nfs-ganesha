      "message": "We would like to tag V6.0 this week so we would want to get these changes applied and merged also.\n\nWhat I think would be the best plan is to get a V6-dev.18 with the final set of patches out in the next day or two, then make the clang conversions and release that as V6-dev.19 and then a final merge for V6.0 that includes a V6.0 tag for ntirpc.\n\nDid you have any plans on clang formatting ntirpc?",
