      "message": "I have some thoughts, and I\u0027d like to start a discussion.\n\nFirst, this fixes the build for LTTng, but breaks the build for GTest (when LTTng is on).  That will need to be fixed.\n\nI am wondering, however, about the re-organization.  The original idea was to have the LTTng modules for each separate package (say FSAL_CEPH) be installable with that package.  Obviously, we never did that, and only have one LTTng package now.  (As an aside, will that even work if you don\u0027t install all the packages that were built when LTTng was enabled?  I\u0027m not sure.)   This re-org makes that impossible.  Is this packaging something we care about?  Or are we fine with a single LTTng package forever?",

Clearly it\u0027s not hugely important, since we\u0027ve never split up the packaging.  In fact, I suspect no one has made packages with LTTng enabled, except for testing.

Previously we created a separate .c/.o file for each LTTNG provider. My change combines it to one, not because you should always have one, but because we should have one per .so file. Currently we have one .so file, so we have one .c file. \n\nIn the future, if we want to separate it to other .so files, the question is, again, do you want each .so file to compile a single .c file or one per provider? \n\nI think it is better to combine all providers in the same .so file, because it makes it easier and clearer to add providers. And, in case you use LTTNG more often, which is what we want to do, we don\u0027t want to create a new file and add it to the build system every time we create add a new provider for traces.\n\nThis is why I think this patch is orthogonal to the question of separating LTTNG traces to different .so files.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe can discuss the question of whether or not each component should have its own .so for LTTNG traces, and IMHO, I actually think any loadable module (like a FSAL) should just have LTTNG traces statically linked in it, and not use a loadable module. The loadable module makes it more complicated to use, and the FSAL is already a loadable module. If you want to load a FSAL with LTTNG traces you can just replace the FSAL you load with a FSAL that is built with LTTNG traces.\n\nThe Ganesha itself having a loadable module for traces does make some sense, since then you can load/unload it dynamically. But, even then, I think it is easier to achieve this dynamics with a configuration flag of enabling/disabling the traces (or having a trace level) than having a dynamically loaded module in Ganesha. \n\nSo, basically, IMHO, the best option would be compile LTTNG traces statically (assuming USE_LTTNG is on) and have a configuration flag to control whether or not the traces are enabled (or, better yet, a log level).",
