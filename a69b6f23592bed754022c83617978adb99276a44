      "message": "I have some thoughts, and I\u0027d like to start a discussion.\n\nFirst, this fixes the build for LTTng, but breaks the build for GTest (when LTTng is on).  That will need to be fixed.\n\nI am wondering, however, about the re-organization.  The original idea was to have the LTTng modules for each separate package (say FSAL_CEPH) be installable with that package.  Obviously, we never did that, and only have one LTTng package now.  (As an aside, will that even work if you don\u0027t install all the packages that were built when LTTng was enabled?  I\u0027m not sure.)   This re-org makes that impossible.  Is this packaging something we care about?  Or are we fine with a single LTTng package forever?",

It must have been, since LTTNG built itself was broken, but it is also broken for additional reasons. \n\u003e It should be fixed, but this is a separate effort from this commit. \n\nThe last time LTTng build, GTest also built with it.  It\u0027s reasonable to assume, therefore, that this change broke the build with GTest, although we obviously can\u0027t know for sure.  Regardless, I was pointing it out.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Why would this change make it impossible? \n\u003e All this change does is move all the headers to compile in one file for simplicity. This is because they all compile as part of the same .so.\n\nThis is exactly what makes it impossible, without undoing this change.  When we\u0027re build separate .o files, we can include them in separate packages in the packaging step.  When they\u0027re all in a single .o, we can\u0027t split them up.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e If you want to divide it to separate .so files, all you need is to add another .so target and move the relevant headers there. \n\nWhich undoes the changes here.\n\n\u003e This doesn\u0027t really change anything significant. It only moves around where you include the headers, this can always be easily moved again.\n\nRight, and I was asking if this is what we want.  Clearly it\u0027s not hugely important, since we\u0027ve never split up the packaging.  In fact, I suspect no one has made packages with LTTng enabled, except for testing.  Hence my asking for opinions.",
