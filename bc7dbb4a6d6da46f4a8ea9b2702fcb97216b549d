      "message": "OK, that\u0027s fair. And if other implementations do the same, let\u0027s mirror them.\n\nLet\u0027s add a bit to the comments though to document that while we wouldn\u0027t enforce a DENY of these bits, we are making generated ACLs reflect that we don\u0027t block those.\n\nThough I think we do actually enforce READ_ACL against non-owner. But it is still fair to allow it in generated ACLs. Or maybe only @OWNER should have READ_ACL by default?",
