      "message": "Yes, since we are supporting limited protocol versions for NFSoRDMA, we wanted to control the access/mount, with this configuration.\nWe would be supporting v4.0, in current version. Hence default we wanna keep 4.0 enabled, though v3 also works.\nOnce in subsequent versions/patches, we start support other variants, user just need to enable it\u0027s support via this config.",

      "message": "I understand the current limited support, but the plan is to have full support, and when that happens we won\u0027t want to have separate config.  Removing config is much harder than adding it, so I\u0027d somewhat prefer to not add these, and consider RDMA to be under development until it supports the full 3/4 set.  I think for now we can just say \"don\u0027t do that\" if someone configures an invalid setup.",
