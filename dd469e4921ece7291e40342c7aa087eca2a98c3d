      "message": "Most of the *_fd structs have something like this comment over the openflags field:\n\n/** The open and share mode etc. */\n\nbut...it seems like with this change we just hold whether it\u0027s O_RDONLY/O_WRONLY/O_RDWR. It might be good to clarify these comments as well, to make it clear that the result is and\u0027ed against FSAL_O_RDWR and doesn\u0027t hold deny flags.",

      "message": "Yea, that might be a good addition. At some future time, an FSAL might actually keep track of the deny flags (PROXY might do this for example), but then that FSAL has to be prepared for them to be there, so in the meantime, I think it\u0027s good we only keep O_RDONLY/O_WRONLY/O_RDWR.",
