      "message": "We need to get GPFS using the common code for mapping filesystems and exports as I mentioned in https://review.gerrithub.io/c/ffilz/nfs-ganesha/+/1170665\n\nIf we make GPFS look more like FSAL_VFS, things should be more workable.\n\nFSAL_VFS casts private in claim/unlcaim to an int fd, GPFS probably needs a structure, but that structure doesn\u0027t need to do the mapping, it just needs to hook to the fd for the filesystem and the upcall thread and maybe a few other bits.\n\nLet me take a stab at it in the next week and see if I can make something make sense.",
