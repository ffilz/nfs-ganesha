      "message": "I\u0027m going to hold off the merge. I just trying compiling with a change to remove the 3rd parameter. All I had to remove to make it compile was calling with the 3rd parameter being 0. Looking over all the functions that are cast to xdrproc_t, all of them except xdr_void take 2 parameters. xdr_void takes none...\n\nI think I\u0027d prefer we remove the 3rd parameter.\n\nUnfortunately we can\u0027t remove the casts since the functions so cast have a typed second parameter not a void *.\n\nI\u0027d also be tempted to make xdr_void have 2 (ignored) parameters.",
