      "message": "The logic here is surprising to me. I can see this logic is only applicable to CLOSE. The comment seems to imply there should be a goto replay here, but instead there is a goto success. Besides, there are two sub-cases: maybe the get_state_obj_export_owner_refs call on line 939 returned false because state2 is NULL, or maybe state2 is not NULL. If state2\u003d\u003dNULL and we go to success, this function returns NFS4_OK but *state is NULL. That makes the comment on nfs4_op_close incorrect and the nfs4_op_close weird.",
