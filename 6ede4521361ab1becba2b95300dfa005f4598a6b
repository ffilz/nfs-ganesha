We are really trying to deprecate this option except for situations where there really is no way to get an fsid from the filesystem. We have already had an issue with the default Filesystem_Id used for the PseudoFS colliding with a VM provisioner\u0027s assignment for Filesystem_Id\u0027s (which wouldn\u0027t have been a problem if they just didn\u0027t set Filesystem_If for their exports...).",
