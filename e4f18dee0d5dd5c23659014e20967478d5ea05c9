It\u0027s not in Fedora, CentOS, or RHEL, and I don\u0027t find it on Debian or Ubuntu. (Didn\u0027t check SUSE.)",

      "message": "`pw-utils` is there by default in libc in all linux systems\n\nThat\u0027s all the following commands for example- `getpwnam, getpwnam_r, getpwuid, getpwuid_r` (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getpwuid.3.html)\n\nEventually, libc is hooking all of those to the linux NSS (Name-Services-Switch)- https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nsswitch.conf.5.html\n\nThat is configured with what subsystems to use to resolve users and groups (files, SSSD, ldap, etc.)\n\nThat\u0027s the default in any linux system for name resolutions\n\nSo there\u0027s no need for any package for it. libnfsidmap, requires the `libnfsidmap-dev` package when compiling and in run-time it requires `libnfsidmap` installed and a configured `idmapd.conf` file (https://linux.die.net/man/5/idmapd.conf)\n\nWe have setups of Ganesha working with Kerberos, ldap and Microsoft Active-Directory and for all of those we are using the `pw-utils` for name resolutions (after testing both)",
