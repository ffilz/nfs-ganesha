      "message": "I could do another refactoring... There is some stuff that saves both ctx_export and fsal_export and then needs to set it again.\n\nAlso, during creation of the export, before calling FSAL create_export method, we have a gsh_export to put in ctx_export but no fsal_export yet (the fsal_export is returned in op_ctx-\u003efsal_export). But that COULD be handled by a single case.\n\nOtherwise, fsal_export SHOULD always be export-\u003efsal_export...\n\nAnd even that special case could still just pass export, and fsal_export will be set to NULL anyway...\n\nOh, wait, there\u0027s probably some upcall stuff where fsal_export !\u003d ctx_export-\u003efsal_export...\n\nctx_export-\u003efsal_export is the mdcache struct fsal_export, but during an upcall, there may be a point where op_ctx-\u003efsal_export has to be the FSAL_VFS or whatever struct fsal_export...\n\nI know on a subcall, op_ctx-\u003efsal_export is replaced with the FSAL_VFS or whatever fsal_export\n\nIt might be worth factoring out all the places where fsal_export IS ctx_export-\u003efsal_export though so the exceptions are more visible.",
