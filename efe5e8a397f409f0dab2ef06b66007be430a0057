The glist_for_each_safe() will just do nothing.\n\nglist_empty() should be safe to call without a lock, it\u0027s a single pointer check.  The whole point of that check was to avoid taking the lock if the list is already empty.  Sure, the list could be filled a line later, but who cares?  We\u0027re returning anyway.\n\nRegardless, this isn\u0027t the correct fix.  Either leave it alone, or remove it entirely.",
