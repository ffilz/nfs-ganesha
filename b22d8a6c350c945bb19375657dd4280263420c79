Hmm. gpfs_unclaim_filesystem is doing way more than vfs_unclaim_filesystem. I think GPFS may be doing stuff by itself that is supposed to be done by the common code, and maybe it\u0027s breaking something.",

      "message": "Hi Frank, in 4.3 fsal_filesystem_export_map is introduced and gpfs_fsal ia already maintaing a mapping between exports and fs using gpfs_filesystem_export_map. So when an export is removed, gpfs_filesystem_export_map is not cleaned. This is leading to issues while setting up upvector which is using first entry from export list using gpfs_filesystem_export_map",
