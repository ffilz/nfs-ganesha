      "message": "Hi Matt,\n\nThe first readdir is fine (for the first 100 entries).\nThe issue would occur the second readdir (with offset kept) because the offset is the boost:variant in rgw_file, we pass the offset for char.\n\nThe offset is generated by XXH64 and add marker but pass char to rgw_readdir2 from ganesha.\n\nThe RGWReaddir would use char type to construct  rgw_obj_key instead of find_marker (the uint64_t offset code flow).\nAt this time, the previous char would make the next readdir get the error.\n\nSo I try to pass the previous object name to match RGWReaddir code flow with char offset.\n\nIf I got something misunderstanding please correct me. thanks!\n\nI would try to write the reason detail in commit message.",
