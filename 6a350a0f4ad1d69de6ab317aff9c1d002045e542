      "message": "Hmm, looking over the code, I think there\u0027s a lot of loose stuff with the client_record. I think we can re-work things so the client_record isn\u0027t actually freed until all clientids that use it are also freed. So nfs_client_id_expire wouldn\u0027t touch the client_record, leaving it to be unrefed when dec_client_id_ref reduces the clientid refcount to 0, at which point it releases it\u0027s client_record refcount, which if that then goes to 0 is allowed to free.\n\nThen cid_client_record is always valid and never changed. And can be safely accessed if the user holds a reference to the clientid.",
