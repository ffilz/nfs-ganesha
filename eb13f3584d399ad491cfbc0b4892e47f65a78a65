      "message": "@Daniel\nThis assert doesn\u0027t seems to be correct for the hardlinks case. In case of multiple dirents pointing to same mdcache_entry and when we are removing a link for v3, we are making the entry unreachable. We will hit this assert than if the dirents are reffed and we are trying to invalidate the parent chunk. mdc_try_get_cached()-\u003emdcache_find_keyed() is handling ENOENT. Can we do something similar here?",
