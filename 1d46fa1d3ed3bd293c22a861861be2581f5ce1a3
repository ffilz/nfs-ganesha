      "message": "Actually, that can cause other shuffling.\n\nAssume you have two exports:\n\n/export/exp1/some/path/exp2\n/export/exp1\n\nInitially /export/exp1 is NFSv3 only while /export/exp1/some/path/exp2 is NFSv3 and NFSv4. So it is mounted in the pseudofs. But when /export/exp1 is exported NFSv4, it will be mounted in the pseudofs. /export/exp1/some/path/exp2 should be unmounted from the pseudofs and remounted, this time on the real filesystem node some/path/exp2 within /export/exp1",
