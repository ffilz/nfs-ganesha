      "message": "I hit this assert in my testing.  dirents_used was 5200, entries_hiwat was 5000.  What I did was a deep listing (ls -lRf) of a deep nested directory tree.  This succeeded.  Next, I did a listing of a flat, large directory (450k dirents).  This also seems to have completed (at least, I got lots of output and my time(1) call returned output), but Ganesha crashed during a readdir.  Looking at the call, whence is set, so it was the middle of the readdir that crashed.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if the first readdir set is necessary to trigger.",
