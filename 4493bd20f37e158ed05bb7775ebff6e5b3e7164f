      "message": "Why is the entire directory being read in before the response is served?\n\nNormally we read a single chunk (def. 128 entries) and then serve the response. With read ahead (used by FSAL_RGW) we read 1000 entries (so 8 chunks) not the whole directory.\n\nThis needs more understanding of the problem before we try and fix it.\n\n\nIs there an associated github issue we can go back to discussion the problem and see configuration files and such?",
