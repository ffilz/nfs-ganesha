      "message": "I think it\u0027s more complicated than just checking if we have an expire time.  There\u0027s also the valid bits, for example.  Also, this will just cause us to call into the sub_fsal without POSIX over and over, every time any attributes are needed, since they will still be considered invalid.  Maybe a better solution is to look into modifying mdcache_is_attrs_valid()?",
