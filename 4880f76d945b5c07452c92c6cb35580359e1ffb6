      "message": "So, maybe this should be defined.  The only thing I can find that would prevent this is lack of state.  That may be sufficient, I\u0027m not sure.  But Ceph (not FSAL_CEPH, which doesn\u0027t handle this, but Ceph itself) does *not* return an error in this case.  We should probably decide if we want an error or not, and be consistent.",

      "message": "ACK. The behavior should be consistent across FSALs. Thinking again, maybe there could be legitimate cases where in FSAL can receive request twice (for suppose DelegReturn by client and revocation by server around the same time) and since its UNLK, it may be safe return success for both the requests.",
