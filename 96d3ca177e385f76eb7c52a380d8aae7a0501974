Allow the domain name to be configured either way.\n\n2. Detect use of the old way and throw a config error with a descriptive message\n\n2a. Do this ONLY if the new way is not also used (so a single config file could be used by either old or new ways of configuring)",

Then folks using old config will get an error if they explicitly set the old parameter.\n\nThe config will throw a warning if the old param is set, and if -X was specified on the Ganesha command line, it will refuse to start. So we will be well covered as far as warning folks the config has changed.\n\nAnd anyone actually using the domain name is going to immediate have problems if they didn\u0027t specify -X and ran without converting their config...",
