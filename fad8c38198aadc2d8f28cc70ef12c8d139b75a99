      "message": "But why truncate to 255? If appropriate let\u0027s actually use a constant. And make sure to account for the NUL terminator in the size of the string.\n\nIf there actually doesn\u0027t need to be a limit, let\u0027s gsh_malloc(user-\u003ename.len + 1); and then the string always fits\n\nActually, I\u0027m not sure this should actually need to make a copy of the string. We should actually make sure that uname.addr is allocated enough memory to NUL terminate the name (uname.len+1) and then make sure it\u0027s NUL terminated, even if it doesn\u0027t come from a NUL terminated string. A while ago I attempted to make all strings within Ganesha NUL terminated even if they were also stored with a length. Let\u0027s fix it all since we\u0027re touching stuff here.",
