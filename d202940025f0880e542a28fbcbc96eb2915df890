It should be okay too for rhel7 and rhel6.\nfor fedora30 and later it needs to be \"python2\" only (or \"python2\" \"python\"), otherwise it will change the shebangs to /usr/bin/python and rpmbuild/rpmlint will throw errors. It might be okay to be python2 only for earlier fedora.\nI don\u0027t know what SUSE, Debian, or Ubuntu need.",

      "message": "This fix is for RHEL8 and doesn\u0027t break any others. If fedora30 needs to avoid \"python\", then we need to investigate if we can safely replace \"python\" by \"python2\" without breaking others like SLES/Ubunu. Worse case, we may need to have some conditional stuff here for making it work with fedora30 in the future.",
