      "message": "It would be handy to reference the github issue in the commit message.\n\nAlso, would 64k work? Do we know what other clients request? I want to be a bit careful of reducing this value if other clients have a larger size and are working well.\n\nThat said, reducing this does seem like a good idea. We can always try 32k and see how it works in other environments.",
