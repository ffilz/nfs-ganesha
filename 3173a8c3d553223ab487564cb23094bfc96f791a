I wonder how much we want to encourage multiple list implementations...\n\nAlso, is this default going to be high enough that a legacy config will work reasonably well?",

Maybe we can have a general guideline around using TAILQ going forward, and gradually migrate away from existing usages of glist.\n\nPersonally speaking, given that both glist and TAILQ implementations are stable and standard, I don\u0027t mind allowing the usage of either.
