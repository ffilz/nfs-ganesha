It was always there..I have only moved both the calls down in the second patch.\n\nThe only difference between my first and second patch is that lease timer is bumped even for a new clientid now...I thought you wanted that.\n\nIf yes then a cleaner option is my first patch AND\nunconf-\u003ecid_last_renew \u003d time(NULL);  in its new client section.\n\nThe code for CREATE_SESSION was bit different. There we have \u0027found\u0027 at various places and we use that for dec_client_id_ref() etc.",
