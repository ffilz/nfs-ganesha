      "message": "Two thoughts.  First, you generally check for the headers first, because that check is easy (just file exists), and only check for the library if the headers exist (since that\u0027s a hard check, a compile).  Second, we have cmake/modules/FindLibACL.cmake, which is very rudimentary.  Probably a better solution is to fix that, including all these checks, then just use find_package(LibACL).  libacl is checked/used enough it this file to justify using a package file.",
