      "message": "I think the endian flag in the handle will not affect PROXY because the file handle is opaque to PROXY. Changes in xdr_nfs_fh4 are not needed. Other changes in this patch do not matter to PROXY.\nPut it differently, this patch is good if it simply drops changes to this xdr_nfs_fh4 function. Of cause, I assume you guys think the patch is also good to other parts beside PROXY.",
