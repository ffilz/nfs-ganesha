      "message": "I think we may need to set these flags if either the entry-\u003eattrs has ACL/FS_LOCATIONS OR the attrs_out-\u003erequest_mask asks for them.\n\nAlso, we should look at the other callers to mdcache_refresh_attrs.\n\nI think the big problem is while ACL may be requested if not present and a permission check is needed, we don\u0027t see the same kind of logic that forces a refresh of the fs_locations attribute.",
