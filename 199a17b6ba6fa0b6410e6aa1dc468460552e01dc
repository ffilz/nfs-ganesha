      "message": "deleg_reclaim is always false, so let\u0027s just not deal with reclaims here. Once we drop that parameter,  fsal_deleg_param_t just has a single value in it. We can just turn that argument into a fsal_deleg_t, or...even better:\n\nJust declare different command values for that and drop the extra argument. FWIW, in the ceph interface I\u0027ve settled on having the caller pass in the desired state. So I have:\n\nCEPH_DELEGATION_NONE\nCEPH_DELEGATION_RD\nCEPH_DELEGATION_RW\n\nWith that we can just pass in the deleg_op and drop the extra argument.",
