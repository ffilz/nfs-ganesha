# Ganesha-Top - A tool for the information monitoring like top

An idea that makes people easy to monitor information that included memory, CPU, MDCache, and Export/Client OP. (Now only support V4 Status)

The whole screen could be split to three parts.

  - Header  - ***Display the general information***
  - Body    - ***Display the goal content (like export/client information)***
  - Footer  - ***Display the simple help information and time***

# Header

In this block we would show the build version/commit of ganesha. Also memory/CPU Usage would be display here.
Beside, the total ops (included V4.0/V4.1/V4.2) and MDCache status would be display.

# Body

Show the really what we want to know. Now support export status, client status, NFSv4 OP information.

# Footer

Show the useful information liek `q` for quit, `h` for help and current time
