But my failure came not when running on any of the environments mentioned in that patch, so it wouldn\u0027t help in my case. \n\nI don\u0027t see a reason to limit the cases where we accept EPERM and personally I think it is just better to accept it in all cases rather than maintaining a list of environments where it is allowed.",
