      "message": "Hmm, that is an interesting issue regarding using additional FSAL_PSEUDO exports...\n\nHowever, this is not the right fix for that. This fix will cause issues if an explicit export is created with Pseudo \u003d \"/\".\n\nSome systems use a non-FSAL_PSEUDO export for pseudo root and it\u0027s also possible to explicitly define a FSAL_PSEUDO export with export_id 0 and Pseudo \u003d \"/\" to explicitly set options for the pseudo root export.\n\nAnd that actually is the solution to this problem. If you are defining additional FSAL_PSEUDO exports, explicitly define the pseudo root export, and define it first, so it\u0027s root gets fileid 0.\n\nWe could also modify FSAL_PSEUDO to identify when pseudo root is being created and use fileid 0 for it, otherwise, start at fileid 1.\n\nAnother option would be for FSAL_PSEUDO to have a separate fileid space for each FSAL_PSEUDO export.",
