Now it is no longer happening in time, since I\u0027ve moved it earlier in the CMakeLists.txt file. 2.8 apparently requires the `include` as well, is in the CheckSymbolExists module even in 2.8 [0], and 2.8 is over a decade old [1], so I just removed the version check.\n\n[0] https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.12/cmake.html#module:CheckSymbolExists\n[1] https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/tags?after\u003dv2.8.10",
