      "message": "The other interesting thing here is that containers can be confusing.  All of the containers here work on my Debian testing box.  However, if I try them on my Debian stable laptop, at least the el9 containers fail to connect to the network (DNS lookup for install fails, haven\u0027t debugged further).  Some ABI issue, I suppose.  I was going to add a README, but ran out of time - it seems like somewhere we would need to add expectations, especially for developers on systems with older kernels.",
