      "message": "Yep, this is all we need to do in the pseudofs, or any other FSAL filesystem inode that serves as a junction.\n\nNote that with FSAL_VFS (and FSAL_GPFS I think) a node can be BOTH a junction and an export root because Ganesha can\u0027t get to the underlying inode on filesystem boundaries, plus you can place an export junction not at a filesystem boundary. Also, if FSAL_VFS or FSAL_XFS have an export submounted that is the other FSAL, or FSAL_GPFS, FSAL_VFS/XFS needs to invent a handle for the junction because we can\u0027t actually get the underlying inode that is the mount point for the mounted on filesystem. A little bit of arcane trickery there...",
