Hence we need to set the right credentials (of the caller doing fop) at this point.\n\n\u003e\u003e  but why do we need to do this for a setattr?\n\na) Do you mean why do we need to set credentials for setattr?  or\nFor any I/O operation, gluster/gfapi expects applications (NFS-Ganesha) to set right credentials to pass through glusterfs server permission checks. Hence we set and reset credentials before and after each fop.\n\nb) why I changed it to read from my_fd now instead of op_ctx?\nThis particular change was more needed for fops which can happen without client intervention like  locks, leases, etc ( callbacks from backend) or close (while purging entry from cache). To maintain uniformity, I changed for other fops as well as \"find_fd()\" makes sure we set right credentials (in this case of setattr from op_ctx) and there shouldn\u0027t be any issues reading them back from my_fd.",
