      "message": "\u003e I think you should use find_fd like vfs_getattr2 does instead. We can\u0027t assure obj_hdl is a REGULAR_FILE.\n\nThat was the initial plan, but `find_fd()` is in `file.c`, while this change is to `export.c`.  We\u0027ve tested with file, directory, device and it seems fine.\n\nIf you want to see `find_fd()` factored out, do you have any suggestions for where it should live?  There doesn\u0027t seem to be an obvious place.  If a new file, would we follow the examples in (at least) `FSAL_GPFS`, `FSAL_GLUSTER`, `FSAL_CEPH` and generalise to using `internal.[ch]`?",
