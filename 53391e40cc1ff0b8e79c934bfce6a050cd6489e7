And because we have stripped trailing \u0027/\u0027 from the string, we wouldn\u0027t need to continue because we know there MUST be a non-NUL character after it.\n\nSo in fact, it should be:\n\nwhile (*rest \u003d\u003d \u0027/\u0027)\n   rest++;\n\nWhich points rest at the start of the next path component ready for index to find the end of that path component.",
