Thank you very much.\n\u003e 2. there is only 1 root object, why does this code make it the common case (or am I misreading)?\nIn addition to the root object \u0027/\u0027, we also need to consider the export root object and NFSv4 pseduo root object. There is not only 1 here, it should be related to the number of configured export path.",
