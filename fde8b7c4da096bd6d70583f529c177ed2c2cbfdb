      "message": "I wonder if we should revisit the config for these stats.  It\u0027s grown ad-hoc, and doesn\u0027t seem to make much sense to me.  What\u0027s \"Full\" vs. \"AllOps\", for example?  How about a default set on, the rest off, and the fine-grained control via ganesha_stats?  Or maybe some form of flagset on a single option that turns coherent sets on and off?  (Note, this may not be a gating factor for this commit, but let\u0027s discuss.)",

      "message": "I agree that there are lot many options. All these options cater to different category of stats counting. The new options mentioned here are off by default and one has to enable it if required. Lets discuss in our weekly call. Meanwhile I will prepare a document on all the stat code added recently so that everyone will be on same page.",
