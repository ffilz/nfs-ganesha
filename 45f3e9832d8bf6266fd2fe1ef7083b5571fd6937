There can be a scenario that two or more clients will perform the rename at the same time both will pass the source lookup and one of them will perform the move while the other can get a success for it as well. This damaged the atomicity of the rename operation. The FSAL should handle the case when those are different entries with the same file handle (hard-links).",
