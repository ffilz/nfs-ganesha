      "message": "I would just like to double-check 1 thing about this.  In your Ceph environment, is `$container` set inside the containers?  If so, I think you should depend on it instead, and drop this check.  However, if it isn\u0027t set, let\u0027s support the use of `I_AM_IN_A_CONTAINER`.\n\nTo allow less churn later, how about using early returns for successful checks (i.e. `return true;`) and just return `false` at the end if none of the checks succeed.  That way, each check is in its own section of code and you don\u0027t need any `else` blocks.  If a section is later discovered to be unnecessary it can then be removed with a simple patch that just removes code lines (without any restructure).\n\nSorry if I\u0027m overthinking this...  :smile:",
