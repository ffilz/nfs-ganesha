      "message": "So, something just occurred to me.  glist_del() doesn\u0027t take a list.  So the combo:\nglist_del()\nglist_add_tail()\ncould be moving an entry from one list to another.  The no macro would to the same thing, *unless* the entry is currently at the end of it\u0027s current list, in which case it would be left on that list and not moved.   I think we need an audit of these to make sure that entries are already on the list they\u0027re being moved to, as it\u0027s not always obvious from the local code.",
