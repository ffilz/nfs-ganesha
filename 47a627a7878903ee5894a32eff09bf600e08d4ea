      "message": "I\u0027m not even entirely sure what the logic is behind NFS4_FHSIZE + 2, and I don\u0027t really see that value used anywhere else.\n\nI do see fh_data being allocated as NFS4_FHSIZE in handle_mapping.c. So, I guess the question would be: should we allocate fh_data with this new macro (PROXYV4_HANDLE_MAXLEN) as it is (NFS4_FHSIZE + 2), or should we just use NFS4_FHSIZE across the board and change the check to \u003c\u003d instead of \u003c?",
