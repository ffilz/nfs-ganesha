      "message": "It looks like reopen2() can bee called with transient flags like FSAL_O_RECLAIM and FSAL_O_TRUNC.  Since the stored openflags uses FSAL_O_NFS_FLAGS() to filter these out, this will cause a mismatch.  I\u0027m not sure if this is desired.  Probably, a reopen2() with TRUNC should not match, and should trigger a proper re-open.  What about RECLAIM?",
